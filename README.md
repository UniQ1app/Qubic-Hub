# Qubic Hub

Qubic Hub is a community-focused application designed to structure how users
discover, learn, and interact with the Qubic ecosystem.

It operates strictly at the application layer and does not modify the Qubic
protocol, consensus, or governance.

Qubic Hub combines three core components:
- Hub
- Academy
- Trust Layer

## What Problem Does Qubic Hub Solve?

As Qubic grows, technical systems scale correctly, but human interaction does not.

New users struggle to understand Qubic.
Discussions become noisy.
Feedback quality decreases.
Core contributors face increasing cognitive load.

Qubic Hub addresses these **human-layer problems**.

## Core Components

### 1. Hub — Single Source of Truth
- Centralized, source-transparent Qubic information
- Official documentation, ecosystem updates, and progress tracking
- Read-only access

### 2. Academy — Understanding Before Interaction
- Structured learning paths:
  - Qubic fundamentals
  - Architecture & consensus
  - Useful Proof of Work (UPoW)
  - Computors & quorum
  - Economic model
- Step-by-step progression
- Knowledge validation checkpoints

### 3. Trust Layer — Qualification Without Power
- Non-financial trust signals
- Derived from learning progression and behavior
- Used only to qualify access and feedback

Trust does NOT grant:
- governance rights
- protocol authority
- financial control

---

## Wallet Interaction

- Optional wallet connection
- Read-only by default
- Used for personalization and trust signals only

No private keys are stored.
No transactions are executed.

---

## Governance & Authority

Qubic Hub:
- does NOT govern Qubic
- does NOT influence consensus
- does NOT replace computors

Community governance inside Qubic Hub is **off-protocol** and limited to
organizational and moderation purposes.

---

## Security & Boundaries

- Application-layer only
- No protocol hooks
- No execution permissions
- Fully revocable access levels

---

## Status

Current phase: Community feedback & prioritization  
This repository is intended for transparency, review, and iteration.

---

## Disclaimer

Qubic Hub is an independent community initiative.
It is not an official protocol component unless explicitly adopted by the Qubic ecosystem.
